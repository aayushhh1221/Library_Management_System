#Library Management System

A practice project where I am building a Library Management System while learning backend development, Generative AI, RAG, and related technologies.

The project started as a basic library management API and is gradually being extended with AI-powered features.

> This is primarily a learning/practice project, so the architecture and features are still evolving.

## 🚀 Features

### Library Management
- Manage books
